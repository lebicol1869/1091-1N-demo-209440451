      <h2>Overnight Spinach and Cheese Strata</h2>

      <p class="quote">
        It seems that for a meal to be truly satisfying for me these days, it must contain 
        some form of carbs and cheese. I guess that shouldn’t come as a surprise since 99% 
        of the recipes we post here follow that formula.
      </p>

      <p class="post-info">
        It should also come as no surprise then that this Spinach and Cheese Strata is a household 
        favourite for any meal. It was a recipe we originally created for our friends at Canola Eat 
        Well and it’s become a staple ever since. And it’s got bread and cheese. Satisfaction guaranteed.
      </p>

        It’s the perfect vehicle for using up some bread about to go stale. Actually, it works best 
        with a loaf of day or two day old bread as it allows it to soak in that egg mixture even more. 
        We use frozen spinach here, but if you’ve got fresh kicking around you could cook that up with the onion too.
      </p>

      <p class="post-info">
        We eat this for dinner just as much as we do for breakfast. Feeding a family? 
        You can easily deconstruct it for a perfect family friendly meal. Leave some of the baguette and 
        cheese plain on the side and scramble up an egg or two if this is a new dish for your kiddos.
      </p>

      <p class="post-info">
        While it comes together lickety-split, it does need some time in the fridge to let the bread get 
        all soaked up in that delicious cheesy egg mixture. So make sure to do a little planning and assemble 
        it the day before your planning on digging in.

        Having an outdoor brunch party? I couldn’t think of a more delicious dish!

        Happy Summer!
      </p>

      <p class="post-info">
        Well, happy almost summer. The official first day of summer is June 20th, but that’s just semantics because 
        it sure as heck feels like summer over here. So I’m going with it. 
      </p>

      <p class="post-info">
        It’s hard to believe we are into the summer season. I think the last time I was out of my house, and I mean 
        really out of my house, running errands like we all used to, I was wearing a winter coat. Yet somehow, three 
        months have flown by, my kids have grown so much and I have grown ever so tired. But it’s summer. The sun is 
        shining, the birds are chirping and the weather is so very warm. So let’s focus on the positive. 
      </p>

      <p class="post-info">
        Another bright spot today is this Barley Bowl with Tofu and Roasted Broccoli. Such simple ingredients, yet the 
        result is delicious. You’ve also probably got everything you need already lurking in your pantry or fridge. Barley 
        is a pantry staple here for many reasons. It’s hearty and satisfying – I’m a sucker for that chewiness. It’s also such 
        a versatile grain. You can cook it up in soup, in a salad, use it instead of rice in risotto or go the sweet route and 
        enjoy it for breakfast like you would oatmeal. And in this dish? It’s just delicious. 
      </p>

      <p class="post-info">The first time I’m able to invite people over for dinner, I’m definitely cooking this for them. 
      Why? It can be served up in so many different ways.
